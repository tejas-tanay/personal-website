Even if I let go of the stories—let go of the winged angels, the elephant-headed gods, the prophets who parted seas, and the gurus who walk on water—I’m still left with the deeper structure. The system. The way these ideas were embedded into people’s lives, the way entire civilizations were shaped by them, often through fear, often through power, often through sheer repetition and ritual until people could no longer tell myth from reality.

Fine. Maybe the ancients didn’t know better. Maybe they needed gods because they didn’t have physics. Maybe they needed miracles because they didn’t have medicine. Maybe they needed stories just to hold themselves together.

But what about the ones who came after?

What about the ones who said: all that was false—but *now*, here is the truth? What about the Buddha, the so-called awakened one, who walks off into the forest and comes back with a method? No more gods, no more fantasy—just discipline, austerity, renunciation. And then, as if by reflex, the same pattern returns: the monastics, the rituals, the initiations, the hidden lineages. What was supposed to be an escape becomes another architecture of control.

And this is what they all do. They say: give up your ego, your desire, your name, your attachments. Become a monk. Submit. Destroy who you are so that some new, more purified version can be born. But by the time you've stripped away your self, your identity, your will, you’re no longer a seeker—you’re a recruit.

And they call this realization.

Look closely and you’ll see the same tools used again and again: isolation, repetition, dependency. Break the individual. Drown them in doctrine. Replace uncertainty with system. Whether it’s a monastery or a megachurch, a lineage or a livestream, the game is the same. Enlightenment becomes a product you pay for with your soul.

Even if you walk away from the gods, even if you call it non-duality or emptiness or pure consciousness, the moment it requires hierarchy, obedience, and surrender to someone else’s model—you’ve just traded one myth for another.

And so I ask again: if maya is the illusion, who built the machinery of maya? And who keeps it running?
