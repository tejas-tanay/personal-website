Let’s say I stop trying to punish the old stories. Let’s say I give up my anger toward the Bible, the Bhagavad Gita, the gods with tusks, the prophets with golden plates. Let’s say I allow that maybe people needed those stories—maybe they were just doing what they could with what they had.

But then what about the ones who came after?
The ones who said, *That was all false—but now here’s the truth.*

The Buddha. The enlightened one. The chosen one, just like every other chosen one. The man who walks off into the forest, starves himself, strips away desire, and comes back with a method. And the story begins again.

Another sacred figure. Another path. Another canon. Another priesthood.

And suddenly, “truth” requires rituals. It requires monasteries. It requires robes and chanting and initiations and doctrines and lineages and lifetimes of purification. Suddenly, realization has an entry fee. And the price is your individuality.

This is what every spiritual system does. It tells you: *Dissolve your identity.* *Forsake your family.* *Cut your attachments.* *Trust the path.* *We will remake you.*

It’s not spirituality. It’s psychological warfare with a smiling face.

And if you don’t feel it at first, just wait. The deeper in you go, the more you’ll be told you’re not ready. That you must do more. That the truth is real but you are not. That you have to keep peeling away every trace of personal will before you’re allowed to taste it.

By the time you’ve submitted enough to be trusted, you’ve given away the only thing that could have questioned the system in the first place: **your own mind.**

And that’s the trap.
Even the path out is a path in.
Even the escape hatch drops you into another room.

And suddenly you’re not seeking truth. You’re just trying to survive inside someone else’s map of it.
