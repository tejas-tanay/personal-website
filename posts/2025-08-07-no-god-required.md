Maybe the scariest truth isn’t that God isn’t real.
Maybe the scariest truth is that **we never needed one to build the world as it is.**

Humans are enough. Enough to create beauty. Enough to create horror. Enough to build temples, write scriptures, shape laws, and design entire metaphysical systems—without a single divine whisper. Just our fears, our drives, our brilliance, our hunger for permanence and control.

Even if there’s no God, even if there’s no ultimate reality, no final awakening, no eternal truth—**look at what we’ve done.**

We built this.

And if it all collapses, it’ll be because **we** did that too.

So maybe it’s time to stop outsourcing the mystery. Maybe it’s time to stop waiting for someone else’s vision of transcendence. Maybe it’s time to look squarely at what is—not as disciples, not as seekers, but as the ones who are capable of creating meaning **without borrowing someone else’s myth.**

Because the terrifying, liberating possibility is this:

There is no map.
There is no chosen one.
There is only us.

And that’s enough.
