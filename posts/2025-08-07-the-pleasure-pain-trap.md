Strip it all down, and what you’re left with is this: human beings are animals with memory and projection. And once the basics are solved—hunger, sex, shelter, disease—what’s left to chase?

Pleasure. Meaning. Novelty.

This is what the entire spiritual project preys upon: the need to find a next thing. A better thing. A more refined state. A more subtle kind of joy.

You say you’re not chasing pleasure anymore. You say you’re renouncing it. But then you rename it: *bliss.* *Stillness.* *Ananda.* The “pleasure” of the spirit. But it’s the same old mechanism. The same carrot-on-a-stick. You’re just burning the lower pleasures to chase a higher one.

The body craves. The mind rationalizes. And what you call “realization” is often just an elaborate psychological loop: you train yourself to be okay with discomfort, you build cognitive scaffolding to reframe pain as wisdom, and you deny desire until denial itself becomes its own kind of addiction.

And when that fails, when even spiritual bliss can’t hold up under the weight of reality, what do the teachers say? That you’re not ready. That you haven’t tried hard enough. That you need more discipline, more lifetimes, more surrender.

But look closely: the game hasn’t changed. The game is still **seeking**.
And seeking means you’re always incomplete.

The pleasure-pain loop doesn’t end with renunciation. It **rebrands** itself. It puts on robes. It sits cross-legged. It shaves its head. But it still needs to be fed.

That’s the trap.
Not desire.
Not pleasure.
But the belief that you can ever escape them by running deeper into abstraction.

Until you see that, you’re not free. You’re just caught in a more elegant cage.
