Let’s begin with the foundational claim of non-dual spirituality: "You are not the body. You are not the mind. You are pure consciousness."

Fine. But the moment I say *I am the witness*, the "I" is still hanging in the air, isn’t it? You can perform all the neti-neti negations you want, but that slippery little pronoun survives every metaphysical cleansing. You haven't dissolved the ego. You've just wrapped it in subtler language.

And if all phenomena are maya—objects appearing in consciousness—then so are the Upanishads. So are the teachers. So are the gurus. So are the scriptures. So is the very claim that all is maya. You can't use illusion to validate the concept of illusion without tying yourself into a perfect paradox.

Why should I believe the people who told me not to believe anything? Why are their words exempt from the laws they claim govern all other phenomena? If everything is illusion, then so is Shankaracharya. So is Buddha. So is the very idea that there is an escape.

What makes them real? Why should I trust the messengers of unreality?

They say: "Don’t trust the world. Trust me. I’ll lead you out."

But you are the world. You are maya. Your voice is part of the illusion you warn me about. You’ve just built a story where doubt proves ignorance and obedience proves understanding. That’s not spiritual clarity. That’s epistemic entrapment.

And even if I allow that some people reach something—some pure state, some realization, some stillness beyond language—it becomes yet another hierarchy. You are realized. I am not. You have seen. I have not. You are beyond. I am below. And what began as liberation ends in subjugation.

So no, I don’t buy it. Not without dismantling the entire scaffolding first. Not without turning the critique on the ones who built the system. If all is illusion, then start by questioning the ones who invented the word.
