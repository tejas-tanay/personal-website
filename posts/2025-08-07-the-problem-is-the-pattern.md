You can call it religion. You can call it spirituality. You can call it healing, awakening, ascension, realization. But underneath all of it—the myths, the robes, the mantras, the livestreams—it’s the same pattern repeating itself over and over again.

Someone claims to see more clearly than everyone else.
They break away. They go to the forest. They starve. They sit. They return with a message.

Then others follow.

Then the message hardens.
Then the message becomes method.
Then the method becomes hierarchy.
Then the hierarchy becomes dogma.

And now the original truth—the insight that shattered old illusions—has become the **new illusion**. It has become the new justification for power, for submission, for institutional inertia.

The pattern is what corrupts it. Not the people. Not even the ideas.
Just the pattern.

Every revolution becomes a system. Every system becomes a doctrine. Every doctrine becomes a trap.

And we keep doing it. We keep looking for the one who has the answer. We keep building shrines to those who reject shrines. We keep asking for maps from those who said *don’t follow maps*.

We want to be led. And so we are.

Not because it’s true.
But because the pattern demands it.
